      <p><li><font size="5"><b>Memory:</b> Computers use different types of memory to store and retrieve data. Random Access Memory (RAM) is used for temporary storage of data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly. Hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD) are used for long-term storage.</font></li></p>
